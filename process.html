            <span class="bold">I started with giving a presentation to the President and the Department Chairs of the University on digital design trends, the current state of the university website, and competitor analysis.</span> In order to build rapport with the President of the University, a professor of sociology who lead a pioneering network analysis of online platforms in the early 2000s, I focused on the new aspects of design in the age of ‘hyperconnectivity.’  The point I tried to get across; design has to be user-centered, data-driven, and iterative as a process and a statement of the university’s identity as a result rather than a static decoration as so many people mistakenly think.  <span class="bold" id="new-team">The presentation was well-received and  I followed up with a detailed proposal for the creation of a new team that included staffing plan, budget, and timeline.</span>

            As soon as the new team was created,  I started regular meetings with my counterparts in the PR and IT department. The developer had been feeling at a loss at the senior management’s request for making the website look “prettier.”  The PR department, which has been mainly focused on Korean content and the legacy media relations, was reluctant to dive into the technical aspect of the crafting digital user experience. I suggested that the new unit of the strategic initiative team could fill the void and asked for their cooperation. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-area">
            Although my main skill set and interest lies in visual design, HTML, CSS, and some presentational Javascript, <span class="bold">I had to wear many hats due to the severe limitation on budget and personnel. </span> I not only had to come up with a <span class="bold">content strategy</span> but also create the actual content myself — taking <span class="bold">photos</span> of the campus and the university events, <span class="bold">shooting and editing</span> interview videos, and create some <span class="bold">motion graphics</span> while making a <span class="bold">prototype</span> of a new website and <span class="bold">reporting weekly progress</span> to the top management. My colleague in the unit was in charge of all the copywriting, text content writing, and overall content creation for the social media feeds.

            SCOPE
        </div>
        <p class="text-area">
            To deliver tangible results within the constraints, I chose <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything" class="underline" target="_blank"> “iterative design over traditional big design up front development.”</a> Instead of a full-fledge overhaul of the existing website, <span class="bold">I conducted a redesign of the index page and added a few pages </span> that can showcase strong points of the university and possibly result in a boost in our online visibility. Since the overhaul of the entire site was out of the question <span class="bold">due to budget constraint, I had to leave the site’s overall information architecture outside of the scope of the pilot project.</span>
        </p>

        <p class="text-area">
            Although our main target was ‘international’ prospective students, our unit was comprised of only two people—one Korean and the other US-citizen, and we could speak only English and Korean, so we needed to mainly focus on academics and prospective students from English speaking countries. 
        </p>


        <div class="small-sub-title roles-constraints" id="research">
            RESEARCH
        </div> 

        <p class="text-area">
            <span class="bold">With no UX expert on board or a sufficient budget for extensive user research, the only tools I could rely on were analytics and interviews with current international students.</span> Due to government restrictions on Korean universities regarding personal information, I could not take advantage of google analytics but had to install a more basic version of local server tool to collect user data. As to the interview, our unit tried to interview students from various countries and backgrounds. We were lucky enough to have the university’s massive pool of over 4,600 international students to draw from.
        </p>

        <p class="text-area">
            The interview served two purposes:
            <ol class="interview-purposes text-area" type="1">
             <li class="purpose margin-bottom-xs">
                Creation of a New Category: Humans of Yonsei<br><br>
                I assumed that prospective students would like to hear stories from students like themselves, who have been studying here in Korea. It also served the purpose of showing that we have this diverse, international, welcoming student body. So I added a new page that showcased stories of our students under the title of “Humans of Yonsei.”
             </li>
             <li class="purpose margin-bottom-xs">User Insights<br><br>
               Although they were current students who had different needs than prospective ones, they also gave us invaluable insights into how they got to know our school, why they chose Korea, what kind of worries and questions they had before coming here and why they chose us over other universities. They mostly did not remember any specific pain points using our website but cited the attractions of Seoul in general, the reputation of the university, international student community, and the location and beauty of the campus as the main reasons for choosing the university.<br><br>
               The qualitative analytics data collected for three months revealed that most users visit the site by directly typing in the name of the university on a search engine, the landing page was mostly the index page, but the most clicks were made to view admissions related information. Dwell time was not short, but the bounce rate was relatively high. I assumed that the layout could be the culprit because it offered too many choices with detailed text explanation. Typical hero images rotating in a distracting manner and less than engaging interface with no micro-interaction except for the cursor turning to a pointer on hover were not ideal either.

              Our goals were as follows:

          <p class="text-area">
              As Steve Krug pointed out in his book “Don’t make me think,” users (especially the one who happened to visit the site through links for the first time) usually skim through images and headlines rather than ‘poring over each text.’ Therefore, just browsing a few images and headlines on the index page should tell a story to the users about what kind of university it is, and it should be crystal-clear what we want them to do.

            The university already had a well-established University Identity Guide which detailed its logo, colors, and typography but it was initially made before the internet existed and was rarely updated, so the guide’s main focus was print media. Since there was no detailed guide as to what screen design should be like, each of the departments (the university has more than 100 administrative departments) were building their own department sites independently from each other. For example, taking inventory of just a few major websites of the universities resulted in more than 31 hues of blues. Furthermore, the designated colors were not able to represent the sophisticated navy colors everyone at the university traditionally used:  the colors in the guide looked too light on the screen because they were CMYK based. 
          </p>

          <p class="text-area">
              <span class="bold">I took color inventories of navy colors currently used </span> not only on the screen but also on university signage, souvenirs, event banners and clothing and <span class="bold">added two more sub colors with varying brightness to re-create on-screen navy colors people at the university already regard as ‘our’ colors. </span>

             As for typography, the university traditionally used a beautiful, custom-made typeface based on Garamond tradition, but unfortunately, people could not use it as a font on their computers since the typeface only existed as an ai file. So, again, the members of the university ended up using all kinds of different fonts they saw fit, which was causing not only aesthetic issues but also legal ones rising from violations of font licenses.

              Utilizing insights drawn from student interviews, I tried three different categories of hero section visuals and messages. One that stated our educational goal and approaches, another that showcased our beautiful campus, and another that highlighted our achievements such as world university rankings. I tried many variations including campus buildings, abstract images or videos, classroom setting videos, and learned that the CTR (click-through rate) of the CTA (call-to-action) button above the fold varies greatly depending on the visual aspect of the background image or video. The CTR of the button placed against the backdrop of the most symbolic and beautiful architecture of the university was three times as high as the one set against a classroom setting video. <span class="bold">It was a pleasant reminder that visual design significantly affects the behavior of the users on the site.</span>
